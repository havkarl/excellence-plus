                                Inspired by founder, Dr. Zachee Pouga’s, powerful personal story, Excellence Plus aims to ensure that no child anywhere in the world is unable to complete, at the very least, an elementary school education due to lack of resources.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr. Zachee Pouga, a Doctor of Law and International Lawyer based and practiticing in New York City created this 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with his wife Kathryn to help the children today that are in similar situations to his own childhood in Cameroon.
                                Born in Cameroon, Dr. Pouga grew up in Kahn, a small, remote village. Living in extreme poverty, he wore his first pair of shoes as a fourth grader. With no electricity or running water, the highest level of schooling in
                                Kahn was elementary and even then only some children were able to attend. Most stayed home with their parents who could not afford the required fees. As a child, Dr. Pouga’s parents, at times, could not pay the school’s
                                fees. Yet, through a providencial set of circumstances (a topic Dr.&Mrs Pouga willingly and humbly share with friends over dinner), he went on to complete elementary and high school, college, three masters, a law degree,
                                and a doctorate, with excellence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2010, Dr. Pouga met his wife Kathryn, a first-generation college graduate who shares his passion for education. Mrs. Pouga, who holds two master degrees herself, works to close the opportunity gap in New York City’s education sector by bringing resources
                                to middle schools in Harlem and Brooklyn that are struggling to connect children to higher levels of education. Together, Dr. and Mrs. Pouga began identifying children in Cameroon who live in extreme poverty to offer them
                                scholarships to attend school. With over fifty students sponsored in 2016, and recognizing the global need, Dr. and Mrs. Pouga formalized their actions into Excellence Plus, a non-profit organization with a mission to ensure
                                that, long term, no child, anywhere in the world, is unable to complete an elementary school education due to the lack of resources.

                                Excellence Plus will search, identify, and select children born in extreme poverty in order to support them to get an education and get a real chance at life. We truly believe education is the great equalizer, and as such, by giving a chance to those
                                kids who may not have been able to go to school otherwise, we are able to tap into a tremendous potential and ultimately lift whole communities. Excellence Plus currently operates mostly in Cameroon with more than sixty
                                need-based scholarships a year and support for teachers to go teach in remote villages where schools only “exist” on paper without assigned teachers on staff.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Excellence Plus is driven to find as many children as possible, born in socially disadvantageous situations, and to give them a chance at transforming themselves and their communities. We believe each child has extraordinary potential, and with help,
                                can seize opportunities for great achievement. We provide material support as well as moral guidance and mentorship to our scholarship recipients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Guided by the strong impact we have seen thus far and rooted in our belief in the kids’ limitless ability to achieve great things, we continue to look for people to join us in our mission. Together we can empower communities worldwide by bringing the
                                life changing gift of education to as many children as possible!
